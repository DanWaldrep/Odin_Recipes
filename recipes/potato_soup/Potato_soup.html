            <li>1/2 Ts Ancho chilli powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper(to taste)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Additional cheese, chives, sour cream, and bacon (for topping)</li>
            

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed).</li>
            <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).</li>
            <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
            <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!</li>
