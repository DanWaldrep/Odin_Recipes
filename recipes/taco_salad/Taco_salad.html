    <p><h3>What is Taco Salad?</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Taco Salad is an adventurous blend of a classic Taco Supreme
        combined elegently with a crunchy salad. The spice of the taco meat stirs 
        wonderfully around your taste buds fighting the tanginess of the french dressing 
        and the sharpness of freshly shredded pepperjack cheese with a smooth finish from the fresh lettuce and sour cream to top it off!

                heat. Mix the ground beef, seasonings, garlic, and onion together in a large bowl.
                Once the butter is melted, add the meat to the pan and cook until browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a seperate bowl, add your lettuce, jalepenos, cheese, and chips and mix together. 
                
            </li>
            <li>Once the meat has finished cooking, remove from heat, drain the grease <strong><u>(NOT INTO YOUR SINK!!)</u></strong> and set aside.

            </li>

                Now, add the cooked meat mix to the bowl containing your lettuce,
