        <ol><h3 class="steps">
            <li>Bring a large pot of pasta to a boil, salt it and cook the 
                pasta according to package directions. 
                Reserve a couple of cups of pasta water before draining.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pan or heavy-bottomed
                 pot and melt the butter in it. Add the chicken breast and 
                 cook for 5-6 minutes over medium heat or until cooked to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, stir in the Italian seasoning, then deglaze the pot with 
                the dry white wine and cook for 1-2 minutes until the alcohol 
                evaporates.

            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the cream and cook for 1-2 minutes or until the sauce 
                thickens, then add the cooked pasta and toss well to cover in sauce. 
                Add a splash of the reserved pasta water if it looks too thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the grated Parmesan and fresh parsley, stir to combine, then 
                season to taste and serve immediately.
